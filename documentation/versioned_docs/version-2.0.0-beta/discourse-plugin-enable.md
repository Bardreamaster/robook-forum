## How to Enable Plugin

After you have confirmed the plugin has been installed and your Discourse instance is running again, you can follow these steps to enable the plugin:

1. As an admin user, access your Discourse admin dashboard.

2. Navigate to the "Plugins" tab.

You'll notice that the `discourse-lexicon-plugin` is not enabled yet.

3. Look for the `discourse-lexicon-plugin` and click on the "Settings" button.

4. Select the feature you want to enable. For email deep linking, you need to fill in the app scheme first before enabling it.
