Discourse lacks native mobile app functionalities such as push notifications and deep linking.

To address this, Lexicon has developed a custom Discourse plugin that seamlessly integrates push notifications and deep linking capabilities.

- By leveraging Expo's powerful features, our plugin establishes a secure connection between your Discourse site and Expo's push notification service, delivering real-time updates to users' mobile devices based on your site's activity.
- Additionally, our plugin generates custom deep links in email notifications, allowing users seamlessly launch your Lexicon-powered mobile app directly from their mobile email client.
